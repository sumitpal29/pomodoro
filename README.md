# Pomodoro üçÖ

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a simple yet effective technique for improving productivity and focus. Here's how it works:

1.  **Set a Task:** Choose a task you want to work on.
2.  **Set a Timer:** Set a timer for 25 minutes (this interval is known as a "Pomodoro"). This is the amount of time you'll focus exclusively on your task.
3.  **Work on the Task:** Work on the task with full concentration until the timer goes off. Avoid any distractions or interruptions.
4.  **Take a Short Break:** Once the 25 minutes are up, take a short break of about 5 minutes. This is your reward for completing a Pomodoro.
5.  **Repeat:** Repeat this cycle. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes.

The idea behind the Pomodoro Technique is to break work into focused, manageable intervals, separated by short breaks. This helps in maintaining high levels of productivity and mental clarity. It also encourages a sense of urgency and helps in preventing burnout by ensuring regular breaks.

The term "Pomodoro" is Italian for tomato, and it got its name from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo initially used.
